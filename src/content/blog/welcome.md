# Welcome to My Terminal Blog

Welcome to my unique terminal-based portfolio website! This isn't your typical blog – it's an interactive terminal experience that showcases both my technical skills and my content.

## Why a Terminal Interface?

As a software architect, I wanted to create something that:

1. **Stands out** from typical portfolio websites
2. **Demonstrates technical abilities** through the implementation itself
3. **Provides an interactive experience** for visitors
4. **Appeals to fellow developers** who appreciate the command-line aesthetic

## Features

This terminal supports various commands to navigate and interact with the content:

- `ls` - List files and directories
- `cd` - Change directories
- `cat` - View file contents
- `open` - Open markdown files in a beautiful side panel
- `whoami` - Learn more about me
- And many more!

## Try It Out

Try exploring the filesystem:

```bash
ls
cd blog
ls
open welcome.md
```

All your changes are persisted to your browser's local storage, so you can create files, directories, and they'll still be there when you return!

## What's Next?

I'll be regularly adding new blog posts about:

- Software architecture patterns
- Modern web development
- Cloud-native technologies
- DevOps best practices
- And more!

Thanks for visiting, and happy exploring!
